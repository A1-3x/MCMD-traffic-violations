# Homework 4: Analyze a Dataset of Your Choice

## Dataset

## Pandas Operations Performed

## Observations

## Limitations

The "Year" column corresponds to the year of the vehicle model involved in the traffic violation. The the range of years is surprisingly large. The lowest is 0, which may represent the absense of that data or a mistake in data entry. 25% of the vehicles represented in the data are recorded as released prior to 2003. That comes out to approximately 500,000 traffic violations since 2012. Are all of the older years (some in the 1800s) accurate or merely mistakes? Was there confusion over whether "Year" denotes the model of the vehicle or the year of birth of the driver?
